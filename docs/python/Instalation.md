# Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is an easy-to-learn programming language used to create software, websites, and even automate tasks. It's popular because it is simple and readable, making it a great choice for beginners. Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991.

Python can be used in various areas such as:

- **Web development** (like building websites)
- **Data science** (analyzing data)
- **Machine learning** (teaching computers to learn)
- **Automation** (automating tasks like renaming files)

Python is called a **high-level programming language**, which means it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It handles complex things like memory management behind the scenes, so you can focus on writing your program.
