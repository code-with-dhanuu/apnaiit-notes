- Facebook created React to solve problems related to efficiently updating their news feed. At the time, the news feed was getting complex, with dynamic updates for posts, comments, and likes. Traditional DOM updates were slow and resource-intensive.

### Key Problems:

1. Slow UI Updates: Updating the DOM was inefficient and impacted performance.
2. Complex State Management: Managing and updating the state of dynamic content was difficult.
3. Hard to Maintain Code: The growing codebase became harder to manage and maintain.

### Solution:
